# vectors can be added or one can be subtracted from the other only if they are of same size
x = [0,3,7];
y = [1,2,3];
x+y gives 

3-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  5
 10


x = [1 2 3];
y = [0 3 7];

x+y gives 

1×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  5  10

# same goes with subtraction
x = [0,3,7];
y = [1,2,3];
x-y gives 
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 -1
  1
  4

x = [1 2 3];
y = [0 3 7];

x+y gives
1×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  -1  -4

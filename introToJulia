# open Julia

# type following
using LinearAlgebra, SparseArrays, VMLS

# also type
using Plots

# create a vector
x = [-1.1, 0.0, 3.6, -7.2]

# get length of the vector
length(x)

# another way to create a vector
y = [-1.1; 0.0; 3.6; -7.2]
# 4-element Vector{Float64}:

# it also shows that the elements of the vector are float64 type
# It also shows the length or number of elements

# above are column vectors
# if we remove comma or semicolon, it forms a row vector
a = [-1.1 0.0 3.6]
# 1Ã—3 Matrix{Float64}:
